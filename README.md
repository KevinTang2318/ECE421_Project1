For question a, I mainly made eddition in two files: APIFinance.java and PickShareFunctional.java

APIFunction.java now take the access constrains into consideration
I highly recommand you to change the API key to your own before executing the program. Continue use of a same API key will deplete the access chances bery quickly.

PickShareFunctional.java is the functional version of PickShareImperative.java.
Note that I didn't use ShareUtil.pickHigh() to find the highest shareInfo.
Instead, I used a self-defined lambda expression.
